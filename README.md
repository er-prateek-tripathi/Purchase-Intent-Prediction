## Project Description

The Purchase Intent Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can help businesses understand and anticipate customer buying behavior. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze various features from customer data, such as demographics, transaction history, and browsing patterns.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/er-prateek-tripathi/Purchase-Intent-Prediction.git
cd Purchase-Intent-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Transaction History: Historical purchase data.
Browsing Data: Information on customer website interactions.
Purchase Intent: Label indicating whether the customer intended to purchase (1) or not (0).

## Analysis and Model Building

The analysis and model building process includes the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- Model Selection: Evaluating various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Training models on training data and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.

### Key Findings
- Insights from the EDA reveal significant patterns in customer behavior.
- The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of X%.

## Results
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 89%
Precision: 93%
Recall: 93%
F1 Score: 93%
These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting customer purchase intent.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to the project could include:
- Incorporating more features such as customer feedback and social media interactions.
- Experimenting with advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
